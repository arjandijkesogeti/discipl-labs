# Zero Knowledge proof area
In this part of the lab all information about Zero Knowledge proof, possible applications, research, design, and implementation can be added.


# What is Zero Knowledge Proof?
Zero Knowledge techniques are mathematical methods used to verify the a statement without sharing the actual underlying data.
In a world were privacy and datasafety are a constant issue ZKP can be used as middle ground. 

''If proving a statement requires that the prover possesses some secret information, then the verifier will not be able to prove the statement to anyone else without possessing the secret information. The statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge, but not the knowledge itself. Otherwise, the statement would not be proved in zero-knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol. A zero-knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information. '' (Wikipedia, 2020)

ZKP can be either interactive or non-interactive. 
Interactive ZKP requires input from the verifier, while non-interactive does not. 
Many forms of Zero Knowledge proof can be found, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof.

# Examples Use Cases
In this section we list the possible applications derived from participant ideas.

Possible Applications:
   - Identity verification (age, adress)
   - Package verification
   - Subscriptions 
   - Purchasing in physical stores
   - Reservations
   - Events (age limit)
   - Coffee shops (Weed Pass)
   - Transaction completion

# Summary
Zero Knowledge is a mathematical method used for proving a statement without revealing the required data. 
In this document we list a few examples which could benifit from ZKP. 
There are many forms of ZKP.
For this project there is no restriction on how to use it.
